    Compass/Sass provides an image-url() function in case we want to have all our images in one place.
    As we are not using that function (unlike slick) we are adjusting its functionality for slick slider.
    Should we consider using image-url() later in the project, we need to reset this function afterwards.

    For further description of the problem see: 
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34572876/is-it-possible-to-not-use-turn-off-compass-url-helpers-on-purpose
